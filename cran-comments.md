Additional comments (ver 0.1.0)

Changed the package title to "Signal and Image Processing Toolbox for Analyzing Intracranial 'Electroencephalography' Data" for the following reasons:

1. The package is adding support to process 2D/3D images, such as mesh calculation, image convolution and co-registration
2. `Intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG)` is more precise about the scope that this package handles, though the functions could be used for more general purposes.
