## Address CRAN submission check issues


Dear CRAN maintainer, I received Prof. Ripley's email on May 20, 2024:

```
Dear maintainer,

Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_ravetools.html>.

Please correct before 2024-06-03 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

The CRAN Team
```

The functions to calculate `dijkstras` distances have been completely removed 
from this re-submission.

We will continue working on solving this issue and include the fix in the 
next release.

Thanks
