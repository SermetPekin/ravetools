Additional issues addressed:

The authorship has been changed (fixed) according to the `CRAN` policy. 

To address the issue brought by Uwe Ligges:

> there is only one stated author. So you are claiming authorship of all the code copyrighted by others.  All that code has authors ... so these people are at least contributors.

`ctb` is added to all contributors.

> We do not consider 'RcppParallel Authors' is precise enough for copyright holders, and in any case they are probably not the copyright holders (Posit seems to be).  The authors involved (not all of RcppParallel() need to be listed by name as authors or contributors.

The `tinythread` code authorship and ownership has been corrected.

> who owns what needs to be much more precise, probably listing file or directory names.

Each contribution has been specified explicitly

> 'Beauchamp lab' does not appear to comply with the manual's "(copyright holder, which should be the legal name for an institution or corporate body)". From the website, the legal entity would appear to be 'University of Pennsylvania'. Please decide whether you or your institution owns the copyright to your contributions.

Corrected.
