## Additional note summary:

We have met with our IP office and open-source software lawyer to resolve proper declaration of IP/authorship/copyright and license and decided that the license should be GPL-2 or later.

By the University of Pennsylvania rules, the copyright holder of this package is UPenn due to how the project is funded. Two new authors have been added to the author list.

Please see below for additional issues addressed. We believe this is our best effort to comply with rules set by both UPenn and CRAN.

## Additional issues addressed:

The authorship has been changed (fixed) according to the `CRAN` policy. 

To address the issue brought by Uwe Ligges:

#### Original reason for archiving

> there is only one stated author. So you are claiming authorship of all the code copyrighted by others.  All that code has authors ... so these people are at least contributors.

All contributors are added. 

> We do not consider 'RcppParallel Authors' is precise enough for copyright holders, and in any case they are probably not the copyright holders (Posit seems to be).  The authors involved (not all of RcppParallel() need to be listed by name as authors or contributors.

The `tinythread` code authorship and ownership has been corrected to its owner.

> who owns what needs to be much more precise, probably listing file or directory names.

Each contribution has been specified explicitly under DESCRIPTION. We also added `Copyright` section to provide details. 

> 'Beauchamp lab' does not appear to comply with the manual's "(copyright holder, which should be the legal name for an institution or corporate body)". From the website, the legal entity would appear to be 'University of Pennsylvania'. Please decide whether you or your institution owns the copyright to your contributions.

Corrected. 

#### Issues brought up during last submission

UPenn owns the rest. We have added "All files in this package unless explicitly stated..." comment.

I have removed this compiled file. However...

We all disagree with this one. `global-baseline-comparison.html` is considered as derivative compiled by `rmarkdown`. A more extreme example, this package contains `configure`, which is generated by `autoconf` and the file has a copyright statement inside. Does CRAN packages (or 99% C++/Python libraries on the internet) list the original author of "configure" as `ctb` or `cph`, or CRAN archive packages that use `autoconf` because of such "violation"?

We have met with our IP office and open-source software lawyer to resolve proper declaration of IP/authorship/copyright and license. We believe that all issues above are properly addressed.
